                        Luffy is portrayed as a carefree, fun loving, happy-go-lucky character 
                        with great ambition and a huge appetite, often thinking with his stomach
                        and comically gorging himself. Optimistic[28] and generally 
                        good-hearted, he is not as dimwitted as many believe him to be, and he 
                        often demonstrates more understanding than the other characters expect. 
                        Knowing the danger ahead, Luffy is willing to risk his life to become 
                        King of the Pirates and protect his crew. A capable and reliable 
                        captain, he never puts his crew or himself at risk out of incompetence. 
                        During the Loguetown story arc, Smoker (a navy captain at the time) says 
                        that Luffy "enjoys playing stupid"; Luffy responds with a mysterious 
                        smile.
