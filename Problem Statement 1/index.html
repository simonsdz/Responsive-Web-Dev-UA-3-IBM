                        Roronoa Zoro (ロロノア・ゾロ, Roronoa Zoro, spelled as "Roronoa Zolo" in some English 
                        adaptations), also known as "Pirate Hunter" Zoro (海賊狩りのゾロ, Kaizoku-Gari no Zoro), 
                        is a fictional character in the One Piece franchise created by Eiichiro Oda. In the story, 
                        Zoro is the first crewmate to join Monkey D. Luffy's crew after he is saved (by Luffy and 
                        Koby) from being executed at the Marine Base by Captain Morgan. He is the crew's combatant,
                         and one of the two swordsmen of the Straw Hat Pirates, the other being Brook. As a 
                        native to the East Blue, he came from the village known as Shimotsuki, where he trained in 
                        a dojo and learned the one and two-sword styles (ittōryū and nitōryū). He is proficient in 
                        both Armament Haki and Observation Haki, as well as being one of the few known characters 
                        who possess Conquerors Haki. Zoro is uniquely known as an expert of Santōryū (Three Sword 
                        Style), where he wields a third sword with his mouth in combat. Throughout the series, his 
                        primary sword is Wado Ichimonji, one of the World's 21 great swords that he inherited from 
                        a childhood friend Kuina, and is frequently the sword that he wields in his mouth, while 
                        the other two swords frequently change and improve over time. He also has a habit of 
                        frequently going into the wrong locations which is a running gag throughout the whole 
                        series.
